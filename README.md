# Computational_Theory
### By Killian O'Suilleabhain - G00379229
## Introduction
This README.md file is a navigation guide for my Computational Theory assignment where I have been given a project in which I explore the television show Countdown Numbers Game and the computational complexity surrounding it

## Overview
This Github page was created using a Juypter notebook to complete tasks and solve the assignment Countdown Numbers Game which delves into Computational Theory to gain a better understanding of how different algorithms work.

## Getting Started
Getting started with this assignment I recommend installing the following
* Python version 3. x
* Jupyter Notebook

### Python Download
1. Visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/ "Python.org")
2. Download the latest version of Python to your machine. When writing this the most recent version was 3.12.1
3. Run the installer. Ensure that you check the box that says "Add Python 3. x to PATH" before you click "Install Now" 

### Jupyter Download
1. Open the command line or terminal 
2. Install the classic Jupyter Notebook using pip by running
`pip install notebook`
3. Run Notebook.
`jupyter notebook`
